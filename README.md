# csvtsvparser

Need to have node installed

In the folder directory type: node index.js

Three question will be prompted in the console

* 'Where is this file located? (this can be in the folder or the entire path, must include extension)
* 'Is the file format CSV (comma-separated values) or TSV (tab-separated values)?' (includes validation if the input isn't csv or tsv)
* 'How many fields should each record contain?' (has validation to ensure integer)

ToDo: TSV doesn't parse
